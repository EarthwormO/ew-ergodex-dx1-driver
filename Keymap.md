# Keymaps #

When mapping the DX1 keys to a single keyboard key, the DX1 keys are actually reprogrammed to send the Keyboard keystroke at a hardware level.  This Keymap is re-assigned as you switch Profiles in the DX1Utility.

The DX1Utility also allows assigning of Macros to DX1 Keys, these are handled differently in the Hardware and actually use the DX1Utility to playback the macros.  The assignment of a Macro to the DX1 key is stored in the keymap, but the macro itself is not.

Basically a Keymap is the collection of key assignments for all of the DX1 Keys from 1 to 50.
