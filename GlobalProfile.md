# Global Profile in new 1.2 #

In the new 1.2 version of the Dx1Utility, there is a new (Global) profile.  This is the overall profile that will be loaded when no other profile is selected, or the application you switched to does not have its own unique profile assigned.

Assigning keys to this profile work just like any other profile.
