# Special Keys #

There are some actions you might want to take with a DX1 key that is not a Macro or a single key stroke.  Special keys are used for such actions and can be programmed using the [Key Programmer](KeyWizard.md) and selecting "Special Key" from the list.

Currently the Special Keys available are:
  * Left Mouse Button
  * Right Mouse Button
  * Middle Mouse Button
  * Mouse Vertical Scroll<sup>1</sup>
  * Mouse Horizontal Scroll<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Currently these act as only a single scroll, and do not continue to scroll as you hold the key down.  You can Select Up/Down or Left/Right after you select this type of Special key.

Special Keys are not currently available in the Macro playback and only available as a direct Key program.  See [Macros](Macros.md) for how to add Mouse buttons to Macros.
