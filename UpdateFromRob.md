# Keeping Keymaps from Rob's Utility #

If you have been previously using Rob Povey's DX1Utility, this version keeps the same format for the saved Keymaps, it only stores them centrally (My Documents\DX1Profiles) instead of with the application executable itself.

# Instructions #

If you want to save previously made keymaps to use in this new version, follow thse instructions.

  * Run the new DX1Utility
  * Create a new Profile with the name you want it
  * Point the profile to the Executable you were using before
  * Click OK on the New Profile Dialog to close it
  * Close the DX1Utility or switch to a different profile
  * Copy the Executable.exe.pgm file you were previously using over the top of the Profilename.pgm located in My Documents\DX1Profiles.
  * Re-Select the New Profile you just created
  * Your old Keymap should now be listed.
