Drivers and application based on the code from http://polygonalhell.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-32-and-64-bit-ergodex-dx1-drivers.html

Cleaned up interface and adding new features.

**Version 1.52 Released** Please create an issue or comment in the user forum if you encounter any issues with this version.

**New Download Location** Due to Google deprecating Downloads in Google Code, you now need to download from the Download Link on left side of page, or **[Here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B_HRDZXdmpoLSTlNTWlidzlDSm8)** from Google Drive.

# New Features Added: #

  * App switching is more stable on 64bit systems and should detect apps better
  * DX1Utility will now run as a 64bit Application, instead of an x86 app on 64bit OSes
  * Moved all keymap files to central location (My Documents\DX1Profiles)
  * Profile based [Keymap](Keymap.md) Management
  * Added Debug mode to record [app switching](switching.md) events and log detected executables
  * QuickMenu added to Notify Icon to quickly select a Profile
  * Added Description Column to allow you to name Keys
  * See [Version History](Version.md) for list of changes with 1.3
  * [Special Keys](SpecialKeys.md) are now available, currently including Mouse Buttons, Media keys and Volume control, more to come
  * Added new option to Profile Properties to create a new profile with all keys Unassigned.

**If you are already using the driver from PolygonalHell, or an older version of the DX1Utility from here there are no changes to the driver itself, just use the new DX1Utility.exe for the new features.**

Additional new features to come.
