Rob Povey created a very useful Windows Vista 32/64 driver that has almost single handedly saved our DX1 Keyboards.  Without his drivers I would not have updated to Windows 7 yet.  I only found the interface to be a bit rough and decided I really wanted my .pgm files to be located in a central location instead of with the applications, to make backup easier.  So I started this project.

Here is the original post and drivers by Rob:
